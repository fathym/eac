# Getting Started with Fathym

Fathym is a framework and platform designed to streamline the development and deployment process for applications. It provides a variety of tools and features to manage the entire DevOps workflow, from development to deployment. With Fathym, you can quickly launch full-blown IoT infrastructure or use LCU recipes to get your application up and running in no time.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of setting up a static blog using Fathym. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how Fathym works and how it can help accelerate application delivery.

## Building with Markdown

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for writing plain text that can be converted to HTML. It's often used for creating documentation and blog sites because it's easy to read and write, and it can be styled with a lightweight system like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). With a little bit of management, you can use markdown and statically generate a blog with a GitHub file-based CMS.

These docs are part of a larger project and were built using markdown and delivered with the Fathym Runtime. Using a large JavaScript framework like React, Svelte, or Angular can be useful for building visually rich, interactive applications, but may not be necessary for every statically generated site.

## Let's Build a Blog

At this point, you may be used to opening up a command prompt, globally installing a custom CLI, and executing a framework's create or init command. However, we're going to go a more basic route to start.

First, open your favorite IDE. We recommend VS Code for most of our open-source projects.

Next, open a command prompt and navigate to a folder of your choosing (VS Code has a built in terminal that is really nice to use).

```cli
npx make-dir-cli test
cd test
```

> **NOTE** - We used `npx make-dir-cli` and will use `npx touch` in a moment. We do this to support cross platform instructions (since we assume node.js is installed). You will need node.js installed to complete other aspects of these docs. Users that know their system commands can use those.

To start, create a new README.md file with the following command:

```cli
npx touch README.md
```

Open the README.md file and add some basic markdown:

```markdown
# Welcome to our Blog

This is our new blog built on a static runtime.
```

Now, we need to create a deployable artifact that we'll send to Fathym for hosting. For our purposes, let's start with a zip artifact:

```cli
npx zip-cli -i ./ -o ./deploy.zip
```

This will generate a deploy.zip file in the working folder that you'll use for deployment to Fathym.

> **NOTE** - If you need to re-create the deploy.zip file, make sure to delete it first, so that it isn't also included in the new zip.

## Setting up Fathym

To start working with Fathym, you'll need to sign up for an account on [Fathym's website](https://www.fathym.com/dashboard).

Then you can install the CLI globally.

```cli
npm install @fathym/cli@latest -g
```

To authenticate the Fathym connection for the CLI, run the following command:

```cli
fathym auth
```

This will open your browser and prompt you to sign in with Fathym for the CLI. This will allow you to connect to your Fathym enterprises and related EaC data.

To view a list of your available enterprises, run:

```cli
fathym enterprises list
```

> **NOTE** - If you don't see any enterprises in the list, you will need to make sure you first visit the dashboard. Run `fathym enterprises dashboard` and an initial enterprise will be created for you.

Next you need to set your active enterprise, run the following and complete the prompts:

```cli
fathym enterprises set
```

This will set the enterprise that you will work with and manage. If you are just starting with Fathym, this will most likely be your personal enterprise.

> **NOTE** - The previous fathym commands will only need to be run again if you lose your authentication or want to change the enterprise you are managing. Otherwise, they do not need to be repeated.

## Project Setup

With the CLI connected, we first need to create a project to house our new application. To do this, we will use Fathym's `eac` commands. Select `- Create New -` from the prompts.

```cli
fathym eac projects upsert -n "My First Project"
```

Now, using a similar command, we will create an application that we can add to our project.

```cli
fathym eac applications upsert -n "My First Application"
```

The LCU for an application can be configured to manage security and server-side file modifications for the application. We'll configure a simple one for our zip file now.

```cli
fathym eac applications lcu Zip -z /deploy.zip
```

> **NOTE** - We'll upload the zip file into the Fathym Distributed File System at the specified path later on.

There are a number of different options for configuring how the application handles requests. To do so we configure the application's processor.

```cli
fathym eac applications processor {app-lookup} [options]
```

Then, we can add the application to the project.

```cli
fathym eac projects applications add {project-lookup} {app-lookup}
```

Finally, we can commit all of our changes to the EaC at once.

```cli
fathym eac commit "Added my first project and it's first application"
```

There are a couple of different things happening here that start to further reveal the EaC and what it does. The system is organized into multiple management groups. This particular set works with projects and how/where its applications are hosted/deployed.

> **NOTE** - There are a number of different ways to configure the application and how it handles a request. It also provides a container to manage security and server-side file modifications.

Finally we can get the application details to get the URL it's running on. (The same can be done for projects by dropping the `applications {app-lookup}`).

```cli
fathym eac projects applications preview {project-lookup} {app-lookup}
```

This will give you a URL you can click to open and preview the application.

# Wrapping Up

That's it, we've launched our first application. We've seen a few core features of Fathym; we were introduced to the CLI and we can see how Fathym can host markdown from a deployment artifact.

This may seem like an overly simple flow, but note what most projects include at the root â€“ a README file. At its very simplest, with Fathym you can host your README file to share with the world.

In the next example we will expand on this blog by adding in some HTML, leveraging additional Fathym Runtime features and changing up our deployment artifact.
