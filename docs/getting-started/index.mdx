## What's that?  How did we build these docs?

Great question, let's start there, but we'll simplify it a bit, as these docs are actually part 
of a larger [project](https://github.com/fathym/eac/docs).

It may seem these days, that to build visually rich frontends, you need a feature rich javascript 
framework like React, Svelte, or Angular.  While these do boost productivity for certain types of 
applications (SPAs, highly interactive), it may seem like overkill to use a large framework like 
next.js for every statically generated site.
