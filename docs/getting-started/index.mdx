# Getting Started

## What's that? How did we build these docs?

Great question, let's start there, but we'll simplify it a bit, as these docs are actually part
of a larger [project](https://github.com/fathym/eac/docs).

It may seem these days, that to build visually rich frontends, you need a feature rich javascript
framework like React, Svelte, or Angular. While these do boost productivity for certain types of
applications (SPAs, highly interactive), it may seem like overkill to use a large framework like
next.js for every statically generated site.

For a lot of documentation sites, some markdown is all that is really needed. With that on hand,
it can be converted to html, styled with a lightweight system like tailwind and with a small amount
of management, a blog is born with a github file based CMS.

## Let's Build a Blog

Open your favorite IDE, we use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for most of our
open source projects, and navigate to a folder of your choosing.

You may be used to opening up a command prompt at this point, but we're going to go a more basic
route to start.

Just to show nothing up our sleeves...

```cli`
npm init -y

````

This will create a very simple package.json file, nothing for us to do there now.  Create a new
`README.md` file any way you like.  A couple quick commands for that.

```cli`
touch README.md
````

:::Note

For windows users, you can leverage an npm package to do something similar.

```cli`
npx touch-for-windows README.md

```

:::
So we've done a few things here, created our first LCU, pulled together our first deploy artifact,
and have seen how Fathym can host it for us to share.

Ok, so we do have something up our sleeves.
