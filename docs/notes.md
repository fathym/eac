I was thinking as a really simple getting-started point to talk flows with the features we already have: we start with a static (no data connections, all content in the site code itself) SPA example site, now use fathym to launch, api bind content, and mod it.

Fathym:
Launch:
Source setup (github/npm)
Pipeline setup

Proxy:
Simple API Key Management example
(inline vs header keys?)
CMS API example like contentful/baserow?
Google Maps API example? Via AI?
Other?

Mods Examples:
Simple JS alert
Pop-up "newsletter sign-up" modal
Google analytics and/tag manager
Oribi?
Some other common injection tracker?

Then get more advanced:
State Flow

We went from a static app to a dynamic team created fathym app!
