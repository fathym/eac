# Introduction to Fathym

Thank you for considering Fathym for your next project. Our goal is to provide a framework that helps your team rapidly build and deliver unique and compelling user experiences, while also managing the complex workflows and feedback loops that come with engineering, product, marketing, and sales.

Fathym is an opinionated framework that allows you to bring your ideas to life quickly and easily, without vendor lock-in or the need for config. It also provides complete ownership of your IP, from the client to the server.

However, Fathym is more than just a framework - it's a platform that allows you to define and standardize the way your organization delivers products and experiences to end users. You have the freedom to choose the vendors you want to work with, configure default settings, and maintain complete ownership of all code.

Think of Fathym like an iceberg - the surface represents the core aspects of the framework, but there are many customization options available below the surface. For example, if you don't want to use our boilerplate or Render/Logic loop concepts, you can use Next.js instead. Or, if you prefer a different server-side rendering solution, you can use Razzle. The possibilities are endless.

But Fathym is more than just code and UX - it also includes a thoughtful DevOps workflow that gives you a strong starting point and the flexibility to customize how and where your app is modified and deployed.

## So, What Is Fathym?

It's a common question - how does Fathym compare to Terraform, Azure ARM, AWS CloudFormation, Fly.io, Netlify, and Vercel? The answer is simple - we don't try to compete with these tools, we work with them. Our philosophy is about finding ways to make all of these tools work together seamlessly for you.

So, what is Fathym, and what can you compare it to? At its core, Fathym is a solution that allows you to efficiently craft custom, open source, and SaaS/third party solutions by combining LowCodeUnits (LCUs).

## Fathym: Your Kitchen, You the Chef

Imagine walking into a fully stocked kitchen as the chef, with all the ingredients you could ever need (well, not quite all of them, but we'll get to that). Fathym provides the ingredients - the LCUs - that you can use to create solutions, just like a chef creates dishes with various ingredients.

For example, you could use Fathym to build a static blog using MDX with the Fathym runtime and static templates. Or, you could use the "static blog from Docusaurus recipe" LCU to build a static blog with Mix + SaaS CMS. Or, you could create a static blog using a non-React based blog and a deployed instance of Alfresco Community.

As you can see, there are many ways to bring solutions together with Fathym, even weaving them together into a single cohesive solution. The LCUs are like sauces that can be combined and used in different ways to create a finished dish.
