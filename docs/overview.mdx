# Welcome to Fathym Enterprise as Code (EaC)

First off, we'd like to thank you for even reading this first line of documentation. We know that
you have several ways to build your next product, to deliver a unique and compelling experience to
your users. Fathym Flow provides a backbone not just for building user experiences, but also for
how a team manages the complex workflows and feedback loops that come with engineering,
product, marketing, and sales trying to fulfill rapid growth and sustainability in
their products.

At first, Fathym Flow is an opinionated framework that will bring your ideas to life rapidly, without
vendor lock, without config, and with complete ownership of your IP from client to server.

Then Fathym Flow turns into a platform by which you can define and standardize the way your
organization delivers products and experiences to the end user that are "your" definition of what
vendors you are locked into, what default configurations you maintain and complete ownership of all
code... your own, personal, enterprise framework.

Like an iceberg, starting with Fathym is just the beginning of what you are capable of doing. Most
of the hooks for customization exit below the surface, exposing opportunities to enhance, extend and
fully replace core aspects of the experiences Fathym EaC offers.

Don't want our boilerplate and Render/Logic loop concepts, then use next.js. don't like the way we SSR?
Leverage razzle.

Your next project needs more than just code and UX, it needs a thoughtful DevOps workflow that gives
you a leg up and starting point, and then lets you customize how an where your app is deployed and
modified.

## So what is Fathym EaC?

This is a question we get asked often. More specifically, how do we compare to Terraform, Azure ARM, and
AWS CloudFormation? We don't. How do we compare

So what are we and what can you can compare us to? Before we fully answer that question, let's take a look at
our philosophy.

After decades spent in frontline development for competitive enterprise software, there became a moment when
we realized that the pain staking process of (re)developing the entirety of what ammounted to the same stack
for every different enterprise, no longer made sense. Even in having some highly reusable core architecture
that allowed us to spin these enterprise architecture up and license them out, they didn't fully represent
what IP ownership meant with the impending explosion of open source and SaaS.
